## Step – 1

#### I downloaded and opened the dataset in the given format i.e. .csv file. This helped me get familiar with Data. One by one I went through each file to make sure if there was any visual error I could spot.

## Step – 2

#### I added all the data in Power BI and created some common Measures like total responses, average taste experience, gender count etc. I performed 1 extra step here and created a new Excel sheet of count of respondents city-wise. This is because I was practising on MySQL and I just exported a sheet from there and added it to Power BI.

## Step – 3

#### Created a Word file and copied the question there and whatever idea came to my mind just started drafting there. This is because I am from a Digital Marketing background and my brain kept suggesting marketing ideas like influencers, the type of marketing we can use etc.

## Step – 4

#### Created Visuals and report pages and published in power bi services.
